**Update: I am on the industry and academic job market**

Welcome! :)

I am Nastaran, a final-year Ph.D student at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems] in Kaiserslautern, Germany, where I am advised by (https://www.mpi-sws.org/)[Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/). I recently submitted my PhD thesis on "Predictive Accuracy and Fairness in Human-AI Teams," which contributes to a deeper understanding of opportunities and risks in AI-assisted decision-making.


During my PhD I interned at [Meta](https://research.facebook.com/teams/cas/), where I worked with [Niek Tax](https://www.linkedin.com/in/niektax/) and [Daniel Haimovich](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-haimovich-b9a49bb5/) on multicalibration of ML models, and I visited [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/locations/tubingen), where I worked with [Dominik Janzing](https://janzing.github.io/) on root-cause analysis of outliers from a causal perspective. In 2023, I was selected to participate in the [Machine Learning Summer School](https://groups.oist.jp/mlss) in Okinawa.

I did my undergrad in computer engineering at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. During my undergrad I interned at [IST Austria](https://ist.ac.at/en/home/), working with [Amir Goharshady](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/amir.goharshady/) and [Krishnendu Chatterjee](https://pub.ista.ac.at/~kchatterjee/). Together with Amir, we won the [IEEE best student paper award](https://interface.computer.org/2018-lance-stafford-larson-student-writing-award-winners/) for our [POPL paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3290366) on data packing. 
I also interned at the [Institute of Computational Perception](https://www.jku.at/institut-fuer-computational-perception/) in JKU Linz, working with [Hamid Eghbal-Zadeh](https://eghbalz.github.io/) and [Gerhard Widmer](https://www.jku.at/institut-fuer-computational-perception/ueber-uns/mitarbeiterinnen/gerhard-widmer/). 
In 2017, I was awarded the [Singapore International Pre-Graduate Award](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/for-undergraduate-studies/singapore-international-pre-graduate-award-sipga) (SIPGA) to visit [A*STAR Bioinformatics Institute](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/bii) in Singapore, where I worked with [Cheng Li](https://www.ece.ualberta.ca/~lcheng5/). During this time, we won the [first place](https://devpost.com/nastaranOKT/challenges) in iNTUition 2017, a hackathon competition at NTU Singapore, together with [Mahdi Abolfazli](https://maesfahani.github.io/). In 2018, I was selected to participate in the [Heidelberg Laureate Forum](https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/forum/past-hlfs/6th-hlf-2018/).

**Research Interests**

The ultimate goal of my research is to ensure that Machine Learning (ML) models are efficient, reliable, and safe for those interacting with or affected by them.
My current (broad) research interests include uncertainty quantification in ML models (for example, using techniques such as conformal prediction and calibration), LLM safety alignment, provenance (e.g., watermarking), efficiency (e.g., speculative decoding), and, more recently, social and economic aspects in generative-AI.  

In my PhD research, my goal was to design a human-AI synergy that leverages the respective strengths of human and AI while mitigating their respective biases. 
I demonstrate in a line of work that for optimal joint performance in human-AI teams, we must shift our focus from model-centric optimization to _team-aware learning_. This perspective has inspired the line of research on human-AI complementarity within the human-centric ML literature. 
In another line of work, I bring attention to the fact that high-stakes decisions made by human-AI teams impact individuals---deciding who receives opportunities---and reshape the distribution of demographic groups in society over time. I identify such biases and propose strategies to mitigate them.
