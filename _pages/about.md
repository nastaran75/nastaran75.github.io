Hi :)

I am Nastaran (نسترن), a 1st year Ph.D student at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/), very fortunate to be advised by [Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/). My research fits in the broad area of Human-Centered Machine Learning and more specifically, I work on designing machine learning algorithms which are able to operate under human assistance or in other words, operate under different automation levels. I am also interested in developing fair and explainable machine learning algorithms applicable in the medical and social domains.
