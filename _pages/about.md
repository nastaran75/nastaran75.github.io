Hi :)

I am Nastaran (نسترن), a 3rd year Ph.D student at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/), fortunate to be advised by [Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/). My research fits in the broad area of Human-Centered Machine Learning. More specifically, I work on designing machine learning algorithms which are able to operate under human assistance or in other words, operate under different automation levels. I am also interested in developing fair and explainable machine learning algorithms applicable in the medical and social domains.

<!-- I am from [Iran](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Iran-Pronunciation.ogg) (iːˈɾɒːn and not aɪˈræn) and was born and raised in [Mashhad](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g2189612-Mashhad_Razavi_Khorasan_Province-Vacations.html) where I also did my [undergrads](https://en.um.ac.ir/). My family roots can be found in [Zabol](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g946416-Zabol_Sistan_and_Baluchistan_Province-Vacations.html). -->
